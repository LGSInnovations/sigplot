# Contributing to SigPlot

Thanks for your interest in contributing to SigPlot!

## Getting started

### Finding something to fix/improve

### Writing code

### Running test suite

### Testing manually

Manually testing against an example file is useful given the visual nature of this library, but also if you have added some `console.log`s and the test suite output becomes unreadable. To try SigPlot with your local modifications, just run a webserver (e.g., Python's `SimpleHTTPServer`) and navigate to your test html file.
